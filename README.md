DVD Backup Tool

1) What is dbt (going to be?)?

dbt is going to be a backup tool to backup diretories to DVDs.

2) What does it need?

Right now it relies on dvdisaster, fpart and tar to do its bidding

3) Will it work on my computer?

Under certain conditions. You'll need Code::Blocks IDE to open the project file and to compile it.
For compilation you'll also need libconfig installed.

4) I have questions or maybe a patch/idea for your project. How can I contact you?

Just send an email to my account. See my GitHub Profile for the email adress.
